Over the years, Canada witnessed increasing in-migration from across the globe especially asian countries including India and China which contributes to a largest portion in the pie. \n\n<img src=\"https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/images/corporate/publications-manuals/annual-report-2018/en/chart-16-en.png\">\n\nThe above diagram represents the admission of permanent residents by top 10 countries in 2017 to Canada (Source: Canada.ca). It is evident that Asian countries (China, India and Pakistan) are amongst the top countries from which large number of people are migrating to Canada. Considering the increasing number of population of Asians in Canada and popularity of chinese cuisine across asian nations as well as across the globe, this project will be exploring the right places to start a chinese restaurant, considering various factors such as proximity to tourist attractions, in Toronto city. \n\nIn this project we will be identifying ideal locations for starting a chinese restaurant in the Canadian city of Toronto. Tripadvisor ranked <b> CN Tower </b> as third amongst the top tourist attractions and first amongst the important landmarks in Canada. This is one of the most important landmark in Canada. Hence our focus will be to identify suitable locations near CN Tower that can be accessed very easily and fast from this landmark.\n\nWe will also try to identify and visualize suitable <b>neighborhoods</b> for starting <b> targeted marketing and initial promotion activities </b> of the restaurant launching (near each of the identified locations for starting the restaurant).   \n\nAnother problem we are trying to explore is that the selection of locations should be considering the <b> proximity to other places of interest, such as Royal Ontario Museum </b> which is another important landmark, thereby increasing maximum footfall of tourists."
